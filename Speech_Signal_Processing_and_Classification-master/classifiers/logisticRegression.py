	#It generally means that your model can only provide discrete predictions, rather than a continous score. This can often be
	# remedied by adding more samples to your dataset, having more continous features in the model, more features in general or using
	# a model specification that provides a continous prediction output. The reason why it occurs in a decision tree is that you 
	#often do binary splits; this is efficient computationally, but only gives 2^n groupings. Unless your n number of splits are very 
	#large, you'll only have 16/32/64/128 groups, whereas if you used an algorithm such as logistic regression and used continous 
	#variables, your prediction would fall in the continous range between 0 and 1. I'm not familiar with the type of data you listed,
	# but I suspect you have a lot of categorical data.It's not necessarily a problem to have a ROC that is discrete rather than 
	#smooth, it really depends on your goals for the model (descriptive vs prescriptive), as well as how well your model fits on 
	#out-of-sample datasets. Many of the problems I've solved in my career just needed a Yes/No line drawn (such as email this 
	#person/don't email), so having a continous and smooth prediction along the range of inputs wasn't necessary.
